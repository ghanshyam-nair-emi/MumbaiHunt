## Project Background

When I was working in Mumbai, I was new to the city‚Äîyoung and inexperienced, which made me an easy target for predatory brokers. Finding affordable accommodation without getting ripped off was incredibly challenging. While I could easily find roommates (there were plenty of people in similar situations), securing a good place at a fair price was the real struggle.

This challenge inspired me to build this project initially as a solution to help navigate Mumbai's rental market more effectively.

The 99acres dataset (though likely outdated now) provided valuable insights into different areas and neighborhoods with reasonable rent prices within my budget. The dashboard was added later as I wanted to experiment with data visualization and make the tool more user-friendly.
